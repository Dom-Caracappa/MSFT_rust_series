# Variables
Variable bindings have a **scope**, and are constrained to live in a **block**; a block is a collection of statements enclosed by braces `{}`. 


```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 1;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    let y: bool = true:
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```
Output using **Cargo**:

```bash
~/variables [?] is üì¶ v0.1.0 via ü¶Ä v1.69.0 
‚ùØ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (~/MSFT_rust_series/MSFT_rust_series/vid8_declare_and_use_variables/variables)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.22s
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x is: 1
The value of y is: true
```
Variable bindings are **immutable** by default, meaning that they cannot be changed during the program's runtime. If we take the code above and append it to include changing the `x` variable, we'll get an error. 

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 1;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 2;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);

    let y: bool = true;
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

Output:

```shell
~/variables [?] is üì¶ v0.1.0 via ü¶Ä v1.69.0

```

This is a basic example of **immutability**. Our `x` variable is immutable (it cannot be changed) because we didn't *explicitly* define it otherwise by using the keyword **mut**, as demostrated below:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x: i32 = 1;  // explicitly defines the x variable as mutable
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 2;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    let y: bool = true;
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```
Output:

```bash
~/variables [?] is üì¶ v0.1.0 via ü¶Ä v1.69.0 
‚ùØ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (~/MSFT_rust_series/MSFT_rust_series/vid8_declare_and_use_variables/variables)

     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x is: 1
The value of x is: 2
The value of y is: true
```

If two (2) variables with the same name are created within the same scope, both exist at the same time but you can only use the *latest* one, the first one becomes *unreachable*. 

Ex:
```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 4
  println!("The value of x is {}", x); // this will ALWAYS print 4
  let x = 6
  println!("The value of x is {}", x); // this will ALWAYS print 6
}
```
Here we created two (2) variables named `x` whose variables are both called on to print their values when we execute our program. As the program executes, it maintains references to the correct variables. After we create a *new* variable named `x`, first `x` value still exists, however it cannot be reached by it's *previous* name. 


## Shadowing a variable

Shadowing occurs when a variable declared within a *nested scope* has the same name as a variable in an *outer scope*.

```rust
fn main() {
   let mut x: i32 = 1;
   println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
   x = 2;
   println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
   let y: bool = true;
   println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
   
   {
        let x: i32 = 42;
        println!("The inner answer to x is always {}", x,);
   }
   
   println!("The outer answer to x is still {}", x);
}
```

Output:
```bash
~/variables [?] is üì¶ v0.1.0 via ü¶Ä v1.69.0
